## Overview

The selection is generated by first running a fully coupled FDS simulation with a time step of $\Delta t=0.001$ for $200\,\mathrm{s}$, where all available fields are saved each second, such that one gets a collection of fields each second and $200$ collections overall. One such collection of fields, saved at one distinct time is called a snapshot. 
Because band resolved radiation calculation (with line by line (LBL) photon Monte Carlo (PMC)) is an expensive task, a more or less random selection of $40$ snapshots is taken from the original $200$ ones. The selection is considered to be representative with respect to mean value and extreme events.
The selection process is summarized in the following graph: 

```mermaid 
flowchart LR
subgraph " "
  a("FDS
  (fully coupled)") -- "run simulation for 200 s" --> b("200 snapshots") -- "select representative set" --> c("40 snapshots")
end 
```

The procedure that is documented in this git is shown in the diagram below.
```mermaid 
flowchart TD
subgraph " "
  a("40 snapshots") -- " " --> b("LBL-PMC (calculated solution is part of the repository)") -- " " --> f("comparison")
  a("40 snapshots") -- "` `" --> c("fireRADFoam_MaCFP (radiation only)") -- " " --> f("comparison")
  a("40 snapshots") -- "` `" --> d("FDS (radiation only)") -- " " --> f("comparison")
  a("40 snapshots") -- "` `" --> e("your custom solver/configuration") -- " " --> f("comparison") -- " " --> g("postprocessing")
end 
```

## Experimental data

The main directory for the FM-Burner is in the `macfp-db` project:
https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/tree/master/Extinction/FM_Burner

There, the experimental setup for the `FM-Burner` is described in detail:
