## Introduction
<XXXX A bit more infoXXX>

## Important

As stated before, the calculations with `FDS` need an installation of at lest this version 
 `Revision         : FDS-6.8.0-138-g51097e3-nightly`.
 
 Similar for `OpenFOAM`, the approach is adjusted for `OpenFOAM-v2212`. Other versions should be possible as well; some minor adjustments of the so called `functionObjects` are probably needed (this is not tested in detail).

## Experimental data

The main directory for the FM-Burner is in the `macfp-db` project:
https://github.com/MaCFP/macfp-db/tree/master/Extinction/FM_Burner

There, the experimental setup for the `FM-Burner` is described in detail:

And e.g. available experimental data is located at:
