# MaCFP - radi-db
Measurement and Computation of Radiative Heat Transfer Phenomena Database

Welcome to the MaCFP database!

The central objective of the MaCFP working group is to target
fundamental progress in fire science and to advance predictive fire
modeling. The purpose of this database is to host high-quality
experimental data for the purpose of validating physics-based fire
models. The working group meets before the IAFSS conference currently held every three years.
